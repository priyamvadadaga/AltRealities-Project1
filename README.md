# The Selection

The Selection is a 3D storyworld created in Unity depicting a dystopian world where every citizen is faced with a choice of picking a faction – which in this case are the 5 elements – earth, fire, water, air, space. It draws inspiration from the popular 'sorting' scene in books and movies like Divergent and Harry Potter.

## Technical setup instructions

* Using Unity Editor 2020.3.26 or above is recommended.
* The project uses the URP, incase of errors, try upgrading project materials to URP.

## Special controls 

The project is static in terms of user movement and the only movement is 'rotational' as the user turns around the centre of the structure.
