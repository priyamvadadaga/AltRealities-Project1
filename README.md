# The Selection

The Selection is a 3D storyworld created in Unity depicting a dystopian world where every citizen is faced with a choice of picking a faction – which in this case are the 5 elements – earth, fire, water, air, space. It draws inspiration from the popular 'sorting' scene in books and movies like Divergent and Harry Potter.

## Technical setup instructions

* Using Unity Editor 2020.3.26 or above is recommended.
* The project uses the URP, incase of errors, try upgrading project materials to URP.

## Special controls 

The project is static in terms of user movement and the only movement is 'rotational' as the user turns around the centre of the structure. 

## Video Walkthrough
(for some reason, i am unable to post the video to YouTube at the moment, will resolve this issue ASAP)

## Explanation / Clarification and Description
dystopian fantasy. choosing ceremony but for controlling a certain element – water / fire / earth / air / space. each faction holds absolute control over the element (potentially linking it to some mythological gods – unsure). the depicted scene is of the choosing ceremony where the citizens declare their powers to the world (akin to the choosing ceremony in divergent). 

elements considered:
* sector like structure with high ceilings.
* elevated seating in an arched arrangement.
* 5 equal divisions of the semicircle.
* divided by staircases.
* sector-like stage. 
* use of different materials – wood / stone / glass / porcelain. 
* each sector decorated themed on the element they represent.

## Reflection
Looking back, I would try to have a more focused theme and develop that in greater detail as opposed to a variety of different themes packed into one. I think I really struggled with material and with Polybrush especially in this project as it would only work on dense meshes and to restructure a dense mesh into more irregular shapes as I have used was very difficult. I would also be more particular next time around with how I use sounds and use them to my advantage as I think they really immerse the user into the VR experience.
