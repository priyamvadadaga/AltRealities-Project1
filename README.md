# The Selection

The Selection is a 3D storyworld created in Unity depicting a dystopian world where every citizen is faced with a choice of picking a faction – which in this case are the 5 elements – earth, fire, water, air, space. It draws inspiration from the popular 'sorting' scene in books and movies like Divergent and Harry Potter.

## Technical setup instructions
